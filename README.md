# sendEmail

> A simple send email function for [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/) projects. 

`sendEmail` is designed to be used with Google Spreadsheets that collect Google Form response data. The default [Google Sheet edit notifications](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/91588?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) does not send the contents of the form submission. 

This script has been used in production at an organization with just over 1000 employees, however please review the docs and submit an issue if you encounter any bugs.
